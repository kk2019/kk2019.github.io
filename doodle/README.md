# doodle

There's this thing called a Buddha board, which is a weird surface you paint on with water. As time passes, the water evaporates and your doodle disappears. No-pressure doodling.

You can change how slowly the trace disappears, its colour, and its size!

My favourite is to turn on the colour-loop and basically play snake without dying.
